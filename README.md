## Chess Game

This is a personal project. I am creating a chess game in C++ with SDL 2.0.


## TODO
- implement mate
- start and end interface
- choose pawn promotion (for now its automatically a queen)
- function isPosAttacked
- move isPosAttacked and getPossibleMoves to State class

*Ideas*
- random move opponent
