## Chess Game

This is a personal project. I am creating a chess game in C++ with SDL 2.0.


## TODO
- implement mate
- start and end interface
- castling move
- king legal move (cannot check himself)
- pawn promotion
- when check, only moves that remove check are legal
- checks can also be done indirectly
- highlight legal moves for drag piece

*Ideas*
- random move opponent
